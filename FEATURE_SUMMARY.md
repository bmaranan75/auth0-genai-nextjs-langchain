# 🛒 Enhanced Add to Cart API - Feature Summary

## ✨ New Features Implemented

### 🏪 Product Catalog Backend

- **20 predefined products** with complete details
- Categories: Clothing, Electronics, Home & Kitchen, Sports & Fitness, Books, Travel, Accessories, Beauty

### 🛡️ Simplified Authentication

- Protected by **standard OpenID scope** (`openid`)

The API automatically:

### 🤖 AI Agent Integration

Two new LangChain tools:
